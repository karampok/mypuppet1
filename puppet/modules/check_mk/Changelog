package existence check to fail always causing an often failing reinstall

check_mk module installed

0.2.0:

* Switched to using OMD rather than manually compiling check_mk

* Added support for host tags and creating host groups based on these tags

* Allow local check_mk configuration to be specified in

check_mk can do a lot more than is covered by this module
